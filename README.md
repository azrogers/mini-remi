# mini-remi

A very simple rabb.it alternative. I didn't expect to keep working on this.

## Config

Your config file should look like this:
```
{
	// the folder that contains video and srt files
	"data_folder": "public",
	// the url to the video files relative to the main page
	"data_url": "/",
	// your youtube data api v3 key
	"youtube_api_key": "<key>"
}
```
